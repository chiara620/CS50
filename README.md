## CS50

# Description
A collection of the programs I wrote for the online CS50 course of Harvard (year 2023). Some are missing and the course isn't finished, I never submitted the final project, but it's still quite exaustive.

# Details
The main languages used are C, Python, JavaScript and more. You may find some comments or texts in italian.
